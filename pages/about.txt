My name is Guillaume Croteau. I am a software engineer located in Quebec, Canada.

In this blog I will put some coding tutorials, algorithms, math stuff, etc. You will see new content in here at least once a month.

This blog is at his early stage, so expect many changes in the upcoming weeks.

Feel free to share and comment, your feedback is greatly appreciated!
