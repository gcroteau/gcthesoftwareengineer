Title: Pushing your AppSec Knowledge Further
Category: Application Security
Tags: Learning

One recurrent question that I continuously get is "how do I get started in security/application security?". The truth is, at the moment, there is no clear path for someone looking to start in this field. There is no college or university degree (yet, altough you might have access to some courses). Plus, the learning curve can be daunting, especially if you do not know where to start. If this is your case, this post is for you. If you are not new to the field and you want to push your knowledge further, this post can be relevant for you as well.

Here are different resources, depending on what medium you are looking for.
