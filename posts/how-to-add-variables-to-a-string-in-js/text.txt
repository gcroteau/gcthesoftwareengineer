How To: Format Strings in JavaScript
------------------------------------

Categories: Web Development

The majority of modern programming languages offer the possibility to format strings. For example, in Python, you can do the following.

[code="python"]
s = "The number %d has been added to the string." % 5
[/code]

If you want to do the equivalent in JavaScript, you will have to either create your own string parser, or use Template literals.  To instantiate a Template literal, you have to use the grave accent (`) instead of single or double quotes around your string.

In order to reproduce the Python example above in its JavaScript equivalent, we would have something like this:

[code="javascript"]
var myNumber = 5;
var s = `The number ${myNumber} has been added to the string.`;
[/code]
