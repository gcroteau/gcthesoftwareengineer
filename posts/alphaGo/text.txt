----------------------

Well, there it is, it was just a matter of time, Google migth have been able to make a program master the game of Go. The program, named AlphaGo, will try to replicate the triumph of Deep Blue, when it defeated the world master of chess, Garry Kasparov. AlphaGo will face the undisputed champion of the game of Go from the past decade, Lee Sedol, on March 9th-15th in Seoul.

If it were to succeed, it will succeed where every other programs have failed. It will also mean that it has beaten one, if not the last game that human were better than computers at.
