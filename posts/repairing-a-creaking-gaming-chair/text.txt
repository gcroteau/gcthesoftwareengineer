Title: Fixing a Creaking Gaming Chair
Category: -TBD-
Tags: DIY

I have been the owner of a GT Omega Racing gaming chair for about a year now. It is a great value gaming chair. However, quite recently it started to make a creaking noise at the base. I was able to fix that issue by cleaning and re-greasing the bottom bearings. I am pretty sure this fix could work for a large range of gaming chair as well. Here is how I've done it.

First, let's put the chair upside down.

The "thing" that holds everything in place is this metal piece at the very middle. It can easily be removed by lifting it from the middle using a pair of pliers. Once this was done, I removed the washer.

With that out of the way, the whole base could be removed, exposing the shaft and the bearings. I removed the bearings and the 2 washers. Now to start the cleaning. I used WD-40 to remove the existing grease from the shaft and the removed pieces. The pictures where pretty handy to make sure that I put everything back in the correct order.

For the grease, I already had bike grease handy, but you can use any other type of grease that can work.

I greased the shaft first, then put the pieces back on it after greasing them.

Now we put back everything together, putting back the base, the washer and the "metal thing" from the start and we are done!

So far this fixed my issue, no more creaking!
