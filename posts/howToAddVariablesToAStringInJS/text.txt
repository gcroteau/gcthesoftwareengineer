How to Add Variables to a String in JavaScript
----------------------------------------------

The majority of modern programming languages offer the possibility to add variables to a string. For example, in Python, you can do the following.

[code="python"]
s = "The number %d has been added to the string." % 5
[/code]

If you want to do the equivalent in JavaScript, you will have to either create your own string parser, or use <i>Template strings</i>. Those are template literals allowing embedded expressions. To create a <i>Template string</i>, you simply have to use the <i>grave accent</i> (`) instead of the single or double quote around your string.

So, to reproduce the example above in its JavaScript equivalent, we would have something like this:

[code="javascript"]
var myNumber = 5;
var s = `The number ${myNumber} has been added to the string.`
[/code]
