How To: Find a Point on a Line Given a Point and a Distance
----------------------------------------------------------

I faced a little mathematical challenge recently. It is as follow:

Given a line with a known equation, a point $latex (x_a, y_a)$ and a distance $latex d$, find the coordinates of the point $latex (x_b, y_b)$ that is at a distance $latex d$ from $latex (x_a, y_a)$.

The equation of the line is:

$latex y=mx+c$

Which is equivalent to:

$latex y=m(x-x_0)+y_0$

The trick here is to use the circle formula:

$latex x^2+y^2=r^2$

In our case, the center of the circle is $latex (x_a, y_a)$ and the radius is the distance $latex d$. Using this formula, we will be able to find $latex x_b$. After that, it is as simple as using the line formula to find $latex y_b$.

Letâ€™s start by finding $latex x_b$.

$latex x_b^2+y_b^2=r^2$
$latex (x_b-x_a)^2+(y_b-y_a)^2=d^2$
$latex (x_b-x_a)^2+m^2(x_b-x_a)^2=d^2 \text{ (Replace with the line formula)}$
$latex (x_b-x_a)^2(1+m^2)=d^2$
$latex (x_b-x_a)^2=d^2/(1+m^2)$
$latex x_b = x_a + d/\sqrt(1+m^2)$

Now that we have $latex x_b$, we can find $latex y_b$ by using the line formula:

$latex y_b = mx_b+c$

And there you go, you have found $latex (x_b, y_b)$!
