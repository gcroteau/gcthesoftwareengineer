Let's say, you have a little time on your own, maybe a 15-30 minutes before you go out to meet some friends or whatever. What would you do of these 15-30 minutes? Watch TV? Play video games? Or maybe it is a good opportunity to learn one thing or two. In my case, I try to do the latter. Here is a list of some of my favorite YouTube channels in this regard. Most of the videos that you can find there are 20 minutes long or less. To me, this is one of the best way to get a little extra knowledge out of my day. Pick one and start to learn new stuff!
